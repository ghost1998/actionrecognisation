TODO

1) Instead of trainmodel and testmodel and code just keep all the code in the same file sequenctially. DO NOT use functions for train and test. Update : Lite, the functions are working well.
2)seq_len is the number of features. batch_size is he size of minibatch. In order to see if it is working change hidden_size to 10 and num_layers = 2, the
accuracy goes to 85 percent and then drops after that.
3) loss.data[0] is the loss in training. I commented it at line 66. Save the model at least cost.
4) Run on ipython, so that you wont lose the model.
5) In code.py I have commented model1 model2 etc, for parameters, they have different params, so run all and takr the best. feel free to try better params according to your descretion
6) Batch size, learning rate, I did not touch it, you do it on ur descretion. I have no clue. Keep me updates about accuracies. Note down the accuracies
